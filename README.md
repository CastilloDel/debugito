## Debugito

This repository includes a small debugger I built to learn how debuggers are made.
The implementation is minimal, it supports setting breakpoints and printing variables with primitive data types,
and it’s designed for x86-64 binaries.
I know the code isn’t polished, but this was a personal project worked on during my free time :P.
